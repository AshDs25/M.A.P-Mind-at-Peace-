        <h2>What Is Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
        <p>
            Like the name suggests, bipolar disorder is marked by polar opposite mood swings—at one point, you feel like
            you can conquer anything; at another, you can barely get your butt out of bed. Once called manic depression,
            bipolar disorder affects up to 5.7 million adults. It impacts both men and women equally and the typical
            onset of symptoms usually occurs between ages 15-25. Of course, those years are notoriously emotional
            ones—first loves, college, new careers! Throw wonky energy levels into the mix, and, oof, things just got
            more complicated. After all, how hard is it to plan your schedule or navigate your life when you don't know
            which “you” you're getting that week?
            Like many mental disorders, bipolar illness is genetic and tends to run in families, meaning oftentimes, one
            or more family members also have a form of bipolar disorder. (It's important to note that the illness can
            start in early childhood or as late as the 40s-50s.)

        <h2>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
        <p>
            Before you self-diagnose, remember, we're not talking about being down in the dumps over a breakup or having
            a bad day, or being super-happy over a promotion or a new relationship. These are natural highs and lows
            that everyone experiences. The classic symptoms of bipolar disorder are kind of like being on the steepest
            roller coaster, where moods dip from the lowest depression to the highest high (mania or hypomania).
        </p>
        <p>
            The signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder are as follows:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cont3">
        <h2>Manic Episodes</h2>
        <p>
            When you live with bipolar disorder you can feel energetically happy with boundless energy during manic
            states. You may make reckless decisions or act impulsively. You can get irritated and agitated easily and
            act out, you can even feel euphoric, have a decreased need to sleep or insomnia, and have racing thoughts or
            a grandiose self-image.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may feel elated, like you just won the lottery, while really, it's just any old day and you're slogging
            through a pile of dirty dishes. Hypomania, which people with bipolar may also experience, is a less severe
            form of mania, where you generally feel pretty good'with a better sense of well-being and higher
            productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a laundry list of different symptoms for this manic phase, and they generally center around an
            elevated or irritable mood. They may include goal-directed activities like staying up all night cleaning
            obsessively or going on a shopping spree—things you wouldn't do typically. Manic behaviors may interfere
            with school, work, and relationships. Specific signs and symptoms include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abnormally upbeat:</strong> This isn't just a normal good mood. We're talking feeling zippy
                    and energized, even in situations that don't warrant it, like feeling giddy taking out the trash.
                    It's like you're not in charge of your mood, responding to your environment. Instead, you're just
                    stuck on cheerful mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Euphoric:</strong> This is beyond happy,your excitement and energy are almost uncontained.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Jumpy:</strong> You can imagine when you have this kind of energy surge, you feel reactive.
                    Picture electricity zooming through your body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Racing thoughts:</strong> It's hard to keep track of everything swirling around in your
                    brain—you have all kinds of ideas, plans, and opinions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Abnormally talkative:</strong> You want to express all of these thoughts, so you're extra
                    chatty and may jump from topic to topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pressured speech:</strong> This is a giveaway sign of a manic episode. It goes along with
                    being talkative and is marked by a stream of talking, without pausing in the normal way you would
                    during conversation. It's like just bulldozing right through and not allowing the other person to
                    talk, talking over them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wired:</strong> People having a manic episode feel like they can stay up all night or don't
                    need as much sleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Excess energy:</strong> You have all these ideas and energy and start taking on a lot of new
                    projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Poor decision-making:</strong> As you might imagine, a manic episode is not a great time for
                    decision-making. Your emotions are skewed, and your sense of consequence and danger are dulled. It's
                    a pretty scary combo. You may take risks like making financial investments, engaging in sexual
                    indiscretions, or going on shopping sprees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easily distracted:</strong> With all this internal racing going on, it's nearly impossible
                    to focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cranky and/or impatient:</strong> You feel like no one can keep up with you, and it's
                    frustrating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Invincibility:</strong> Along with this surge of energy and risk-taking, you get a huge
                    boost in self-confidence. Even people who are shy or humble may suddenly seem arrogant and think
                    they can literally do anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>High sex drive:</strong> You're constantly thinking about and wanting sex.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unattainable plans:</strong> You're determined to book a trip to Paris—even though you don't
                    have the funds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Psychosis:</strong> A detachment from reality that may include delusions or hallucinations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont4">
        <h2>Depressive Episodes</h2>
        <p>
            And here comes the crash. You may feel overwhelming sadness or an urge to cry, experience feelings of
            hopelessness and worthlessness, and have a negative outlook on life. You may have an increased need to
            sleep, not be able to complete daily tasks and feel deeply demoralized. This isn't just mild sadness but for
            some can be debilitating depression that can even lead to suicidal thoughts. Again, this can happen when
            nothing in your environment has brought on this mood.
        </p>
        <p>
            “In the most severe instances of bipolar, psychotic features including hallucinations or delusions can be
            present during extreme mood events,” says Michael Pipich, MS, LMFT, a psychotherapist and author of Owning
            Bipolar: How Patients and Families Can Take Control of Bipolar Disorder.
            Specific signs and symptoms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low energy:</strong> This is the kind of energy drain that makes you just want to lay on the
                couch or under the covers all day.</li>
            <li><strong>Low motivation:</strong> You just don't feel like doing anything.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of interest</strong> and finding no pleasure or interest in day-to-day activities. This is
                a classic depression syndrome—things that used to be interesting and fun hold no appeal anymore.</li>
            <li><strong>Feeling sad, tearful, hopeless, or empty on a daily basis.</strong> Picture feeling blah with a
                tinge of sorrow, like the way you feel at the end of a really sad movie when you're done crying, the
                credits are rolling, but you just can't turn the tv off; it's like you're immobile.</li>
            <li><strong>Hopelessness:</strong> You can't picture anything good in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight fluctuations:</strong> Depending on whether depression zaps or increases your appetite, a
                person suffering may gain or lose a significant amount of weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Feelings of fatigue:</strong> You feel so tired and just want to sleep. (Though insomnia is also
                a symptom.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Indecisiveness:</strong> Maybe it's because you feel hopeless or ambivalent about everything,
                but you really can't make your mind up, even about small things'</li>
            <li><strong>Inability to concentrate:</strong> You lose your focus.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            And just when you think your mood has hit rock bottom, the ride takes you back up to the summit with
            feelings of euphoria and endless energy. It's these extreme mood swings that define bipolar disorder. They
            can occur as frequently as weekly, or, show up more sporadically—maybe just twice a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike a predictable monthly cycle or known allergy that triggers a reaction, there's no defined pattern or
            predictability to the mood swings—i.e. you can't plan a job interview or vacation a week from Monday when
            you'll be symptom-free. The condition just doesn't work like that. And, there's no rhyme or rhythm to which
            will come first, the depression or the mania or vice versa. What's more, the length of time you're in one
            state or the other can vary, too.

        <h2>What Causes Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
        <p>
            Like most mental illnesses, researchers haven't pinpointed a single cause, but it seems that a combination
            of genes and environmental factors can awaken bipolar. Scientists have learned that a number of genes are
            associated with the disorder, meaning it's about 80 percent genetic. If you have a first-degree relative
            with the disorder, you're at higher risk for developing it, and if you have relatives with other mental
            health conditions, you may have increased risk as well. But not everyone who has bipolar disorder in their
            family will get the illness.
            Scientists have learned that a number of genes are associated with the disorder, meaning it's about 80%
            genetic. If you have a first-degree relative with the disorder, you're at higher risk for developing it, and
            if you have relatives with other mental health conditions, you may have increased risk as well. But not
            everyone who has bipolar disorder in their family will get the illness.

        </p>
        <p>
            Environmental factors also play a role in developing bipolar. And these interact with genetic
            predispositions to trigger the onset of the disorder. These include diet, sleep, substance use and abuse,
            the stability of your relationships, the atmosphere in the home if you're an adolescent, stress, and early
            childhood trauma. This means is that if you're living with bipolar disorder, it was probably a mixture of
            genes and environmental factors or life events that triggered the disorder to present itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some people who have bipolar have suffered from some type of early traumatic event, abuse, or a
            troubling and/or stressful episode, many others cannot link to anything specific in their past.
        </p>
        <p>
            With those differences, it's not surprising that bipolar disorder is frequently misidentified and
            mistreated. “Research shows that nearly two-thirds of people with bipolar have been misdiagnosed at least
            one time in their lives and will have suffered nearly 10 years of untreated symptoms before receiving proper
            care,” Pipich says.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gap in treatment is usually the result of misunderstanding bipolar illness—how it presents itself in
            episodes that can come and go, and the stigma of having a chronic mental illness, especially when symptoms
            are present in a young person, explains Pipich.
        </p>
        <p>
            And sometimes, other issues are simply masking the bipolar. Many patients will be diagnosed with the
            condition only after they seek sobriety for alcohol or drug abuse. Why the link? People often like how they
            feel when they are manic and think that level of creativity, productivity, and euphoria is helpful to their
            life so they try to replace it with substances like drugs and alcohol, explains Michelle English, LCSW,
            co-founder and clinical director of Healthy Life Recovery, a San Diego-based rehab and addiction center. “On
            the flipside, manic people with bipolar disorders may use substances to help them relax, sleep, and calm
            down,” English says.
        </p>
        <p>
            What's important is if you suspect you may have bipolar disorder, see your doctor so you can manage the
            condition and live a productive life without the ups and downs of extreme mood swings.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cont6">
        <h2>What's Going On In The Brain?</h2>
        <p>
            Up until recently, researchers hadn't been able to distinguish a person with bipolar's brain from a person
            without the disorder on a scan. But science is making some tracks. A 2019 study that looked at the brains of
            people with bipolar and those with depression on functional MRI scans correctly differentiated their brains
            about 80% of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The findings suggest differences in the amygdala, the emotion center of the brain, of people with bipolar
            when they process emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and joy, and could become a marker to help identify
            bipolar disorder on brain scans. Likewise, bipolar affects brain biochemistry and neurotransmitters in the
            brain that produce chemical variations such as oxytocin, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. These chemicals may
            be unbalanced in the brains of people with bipolar disorders. But as of yet, researchers aren't clear on how
            too little GABA or too many oxytocin-active neurons play a role in the disorder or whether measuring them
            can help.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cont7">
        <p>
            Bipolar disorders are most common in older adolescents and teens, but children can also be diagnosed with
            the disorder at a younger age. While not nearly as common in children as it is in adults, research studies
            have revealed that bipolar disorder affects as many as 3% of all children and up to 7% of children receiving
            outpatient psychiatric care. (The numbers are even higher in children hospitalized for inpatient psychiatric
            treatment.) Bipolar disorder has been diagnosed in children as young as 5. When young children experience
            symptoms, this is called early-onset bipolar disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bipolar disorder is more likely to affect the children of parents who have the disorder. When one parent has
            bipolar disorder, the risk to each child is l5 to 30%. When both parents have bipolar disorder, the risk
            increases to 50 to 75%. (National Institute of Mental Health)
        </p>
        <p>
            Bipolar in kids also causes distinct mood episodes from mania or hypomania to depression. However, because
            kids and adolescents can act out, have difficulty in school or at home, and display some of the symptoms of
            bipolar disorders, like restlessness, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and an inflated view of capabilities,
            even when they don't have the disorder, it can be difficult to diagnose.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that a number of other childhood disorders cause bipolar-like symptoms, including
            attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety
            disorders, and major depression. Arriving at the correct diagnosis presents challenges because these and
            other mental health conditions often occur along with bipolar disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your child is struggling with behaviors like a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, negative
            thinking, suicidal thoughts, or a decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, or aggressive or socially
            inappropriate behavior, they should see a mental health professional that specializes in children. And for
            kids with a family history of bipolar, parents should be vigilant about watching for symptoms and looking
            for help early. Getting diagnosed and treated earlier can prevent serious consequences and help kids keep
            their moods in check and manage symptoms from a younger age.

        <h2>How Is Bipolar Disorder Treated?</h2>
        <p>
            Medications and psychotherapy are the most commonly prescribed treatment plans for people suffering from
            bipolar disorder. And the success rate of these plans is very high if you follow them consistently.
        </p>
        <h3>Medications</h3>
        <p>
            Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your provider may prescribe medication to help get you out of a
            manic or depressive state. Avoiding drugs and alcohol and taking your medication as prescribed—even on days
            you feel fine—can help you lead a normal, productive life. The most common medications used to treat
            bipolar:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mood stabilizers</strong> work to level your mood, so it won't tip toward mania or
                    depression. Lithium is one of the most well-known and effective mood stabilizers for people with
                    bipolar disorder.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Antidepressants</strong> work for depressive states, so if that is your most severe symptom,
                    you may also benefit from one of many types of antidepressants prescribed to treat bipolar
                    disorders.

                    <strong>Atypical antipsychotics</strong> may be used if your bipolar disorder symptoms include
                    hallucinations, delusions, or severe mania. There are a number of antipsychotics also used in the
                    treatment of bipolar disorders.

                Often, the first course of drug therapy is the prescription of mood stabilizers. You may also be
                prescribed an anticonvulsant for use as a mood stabilizer. Atypical antipsychotics are sometimes
                combined with antidepressants to treat the disorders.

                Because the use of antidepressants can trigger hypomanic or manic states, you will likely take an
                antidepressant with a mood stabilizer to even out your emotions. “We usually choose a medication based
                on a predominant symptom like, say, not sleeping at all,” Dr. Narasimhan says. “I may choose an agent
                that is very sedating while stabilizing their mood.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “If a person has bipolar II and is predominantly depressed, I may choose an agent that works well but
                requires a slow titration, where you have to increase the dose slowly,” she says. If someone has more
                mild symptoms that can afford to wait over six to eight weeks as their dose gets perfected, that works
                well, too. “It's a tailored approach.”

                Most patients respond very well to medicine, some just with a minimum dose. Other times doses need to be
                increased or a second medication added. Some meds can take up to six weeks to kick in, so if yours isn't
                working by then, your physician might need to tweak it.

            <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Psychotherapy</strong>Studies show psychotherapy has also been an effective tool for people
                living with bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you learn how to change negative or
                harmful thoughts or behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Family-focused </strong> therapies involve family members and focus on teaching you coping
                strategies, communication, and problem-solving techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)</strong> is often used in treating bipolar
                disorder as well, as this form of psychotherapy focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms—sleep,
                wake, mealtimes—to introduce consistent routines to better manage moods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dialectical behavior therapy, (DBT)</strong> is also an effective treatment for bipolar
                disorders. DBT concentrates on regulating your emotions better so when you're manic, you can have tools
                to help cope, English explains. She says you may do sensory type activities like breath work to calm
                down or put your feet in water or hold a frozen object to help bring you back to reality and teach you
                to live in the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Psychoeducation</strong> has also been a powerful therapeutic tool to teach those living with
                bipolar disorder about their condition and how to treat it. This education allows you to notice triggers
                and impending mood swings so you can seek treatment before a full-blown episode happens.
