        <h2>What Is Anxiety?</h2>

        <p>Who hasn't occasionally tossed and turned worrying about the what-ifs in life—job security, health concerns,
            money woes, or relationship issues? Angst is a natural response to life’s ups, downs, twists, and turns.</p>
        <p>
            “A certain amount of worry and hyper-vigilance can be considered normal and healthy reactions to life
            circumstances or immediate threats,” explains Marni Goldberg, LMFT, LPCC, whose San Diego, California-based
            practice, Mindful Matters Counseling, specializes in anxiety, sensitivity, and life transitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, anxiety, that uneasy, unsettling feeling that something unwelcome or uncertain is about to happen,
            can even have some benefits. “Anxiety can help motivate you to work hard on important tasks, for example, or
            protect yourself against an immediate threat of violence when your fight-or-flight instinct kicks in,” she
            adds.
        </p>
        <p>
            But anxiety can quickly take a turn from motivator to underminer when it brings along physical symptoms—your
            heart starts racing, you sweat or get chills, your chest tightens, or you have trouble focusing—and there
            are no immediate or dangerous threats present. Other symptoms can include shaking, stomachaches, excessive
            worrying, ruminating, or avoidance of certain places, activities, or even people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the thing: anxiety by itself is not a disorder, says James Seymour, MD, director of the Chrysalis
            Program at Sierra Tucson, a residential treatment center for people struggling with a variety of depressive
            and mood disorders located in Tucson, Arizona.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It's a physical and emotional symptom that we all experience, and it can have value. It is a sign that
            something is wrong, physically or emotionally, or that we're not safe in the environment or within
            ourselves,” he says. “Anxiety becomes problematic, however, when it affects functioning. When it's not
            transient or fleeting, but static,” he adds. “That's when it's considered an anxiety disorder.”

        <h2>What Is An Anxiety Disorder?</h2>
        <p>
            Anxiety disorder is an umbrella term that refers to a category of psychiatric conditions characterized by
            extreme fear or worry. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting
            40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.1
            In addition, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, 1 in 13 people suffer from anxiety.
            In fact, WHO reports that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders worldwide with generalized
            anxiety disorder (GAD) topping the list followed by specific phobia, major depressive disorder, and social
            phobia.2 In this 2017 study, researchers estimate that 792 million people live with a mental health
            disorder—slightly more than one in 10 people globally (10.7%).
            The largest number of people had an anxiety disorder, estimated at around four percent of the
            population—that 284 million, a staggering number.

        <h2>The Six Common Types of Anxiety Disorders</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</strong> is characterized by persistent and excessive worry
                about everything. People with (GAD) may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money,
                health, family, work, or other issues. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry.
                They may worry more than what seems warranted about actual events or expect the worst, even when there
                is no apparent reason for concern.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Agoraphobia:</strong> Technically, this is defined by intense fear and anxiety of any place or
                situation where escape might be difficult. Agoraphobia involves avoidance of situations such as being
                alone outside of the home; traveling in a car, bus, or airplane; or being in a crowded area. You may
                think of it as people who are afraid to leave their houses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Panic Disorder:</strong> People who experience spontaneous, seemingly out-of-the-blue panic
                attacks and are very preoccupied with the fear of a recurring attack. Panic attacks occur unexpectedly,
                sometimes even when waking up from sleep. It's not like you're necessarily thinking about something
                specific and the worry spirals into a panic attack.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Phobias</strong> are strong, irrational fear reactions in the presence or anticipation of a
                specific object, place, or situation. Fear of heights is an example.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Separation Anxiety</strong> Separation anxiety refers to excessive fear or worries about
                separation from home or someone very close to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Social Anxiety Disorder</strong> is a condition characterized by intense anxiety related to a
                fear of being judged, negatively evaluated, or rejected in a social or performance situation is also
                known as social anxiety disorder.
            </li>

        <h2>Anxiety In Kids And Teens</h2>
        <p>
            Anxiety disorders are not exclusively adult afflictions either — angst can strike even young kids. According
            to ADAA, one in eight children struggles with an anxiety disorder. The Centers For Disease Control and
            Prevention (CDC) says 7.1% of children age 13-18 have some type of diagnosed anxiety disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prevalence rates of anxiety tend to increase with age and this increase is thought to be a function of how
            our thought processes mature. That is, as our thinking develops it plays a considerable role in viewing
            stressors. This is observed early on when signs of separation anxiety may first be seen when younger
            children start school and struggle to adjust to leaving the comfort of their home and family. A teen’s
            perspective of their world and how their peers view them (e.g., being embarrassed, bullied, or other public
            humiliating experience) are key factors in the manifestation of social anxiety and its onset most often
            appears during puberty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting a handle on anxiety during childhood is important. Research has shown that children and teens with
            untreated anxiety disorders are at higher risk of poor performance in school, social avoidance, and
            substance use, as well as comorbidities including eating disorders and ADHD. Therapy, medication in some
            cases, and familial support can help kids manage their anxiety, learn coping mechanisms early on, and lead
            healthy lives.

        <h3 class="cnt8h3">Signs and symptoms to watch out for:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Perpetual state of constant worry.</li>
            <li>Inability to relax or enjoy quiet time.</li>
            <li>Feeling tense all the time.</li>
            <li>Muscle tightness or body aches.</li>
            <li>Avoidance of stressful situations.</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
            <li>Feeling constantly overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Not being able to sleep at all or to sleep well.</li>
            <li>Feeling jumpy, on edge, or restless.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

        <h2>Treat Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h2>
        <p>
            Some people find that medication alone can be helpful in the treatment of GAD, while others are more likely
            to benefit from psychotherapy. Some find that the combination of psychotherapy and medication is the best
            course of action. Engaging in certain behaviors may also ease your anxiety and promote a healthier
            lifestyle.
        </p>
        <h3>These include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily exercise. Studies have shown that aerobic exercise can decrease overall levels of tension, elevate
                and stabilize mood, and improve sleep and self-esteem. As little as five minutes of daily exercise can
                have anti-anxiety effects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet. A healthy diet can’t cure anxiety, but it can contribute to
                overall health and wellbeing. Eating breakfast high in protein, consuming foods high in complex
                carbohydrates, drinking water, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and paying attention to food sensitivities
                can increase energy and motivation, reduce physical symptoms associated with anxiety, and improve mood
                overall.
