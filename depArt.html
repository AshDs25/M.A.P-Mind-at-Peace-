        <h2>What Is Depression?</h2>

        <p>Imagine depression as a weather forecast for your mood. There’s a 100% chance of clouds and showers on
            Monday. Tuesday, too. Wednesday looks just as grim. Actually, the next two weeks show nothing but storms.
            You’re stuck in this crappy weather pattern and there seems to be no relief in sight. </p>
        <p>
            You might feel alone, but you have lots of company. Depression—or major depressive disorder (MDD), the term
            for clinical depression—is one of the most common mental health conditions, affecting an estimated 350
            million people in all age groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let’s just get this out of the way: Depression isn’t the same as being sad. It’s normal to feel blue or
            unmotivated from time to time, but depression is more constant. And, it has a real, biological basis. It’s a
            serious mood disorder that can negatively impact your health and quality of life, as well as those closest
            to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clinical definition, based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
            Health Disorders (DSM-5), is “a period of at least two weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or
            loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and had a majority of specified symptoms, such as problems
            with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, or self-worth.” This definition excludes grief after mourning.
        </p>
        <p>
            As many as two-thirds of people struggling with depression literally try to grin and bear it—they don’t seek
            or receive the help they need to cope—and those who do often let months go by before bringing it up with
            their doctor. Depression can stick around for years if left untreated and can lead to physical symptoms or
            even thoughts of suicide. Even if an episode resolves on its own, it could recur.
            Thankfully, the stigma around mental health conditions like depression continues to lift. And with screening
            for depression now available within primary care, the hope is that more people gain access to the treatment
            they need.

        <h2>How Common Is Depression?</h2>
        <p>
            Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the country. An estimated 17.3 million adults
            in the US reported having at least one major depressive episode over the course of a year, a 2017 report by
            the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) shows.
            That’s 7.1% of all adults ages 18 and older. Women have a higher prevalence of experiencing a major
            depressive episode than men (8.7% compared to 5.3% for adult males).
        </p>

        <p>
            Depression is especially crushing for the workforce: It’s the number one leading cause of disability
            worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The total economic burden of MDD is estimated to be
            $210.5 billion per year in the United States alone—a figure that reflects costs associated with missed days,
            reduced productivity, treatment for depression, and suicide.

    <div class="cont3">
        <h2>What Are the Causes of Depression?</h2>
        <p>
            There is no one single cause for the onset of depression because a combination of genetic, biological,
            environmental, and psychological factors all play a role. These include: <br> <br>
            • The brain’s physical structure or chemistry. In some people with depression, brain scans indicate a
            smaller hippocampus, which plays a role in long-term memory. Research shows that ongoing exposure to stress
            can impair the growth of nerve cells in this part of the brain. <br>
            • Serotonin levels are out of balance. Here’s another thing that’s going on in the brain that may be
            connected, the serotonin receptors act differently than in someone without depression. This is why some of
            the treatment drugs work with serotonin. <br>
            • History of depression in the family. Someone with a parent or sibling with MDD has a two or three-times
            greater risk of developing depression than the average person (or a 20-30% chance vs. 10%). <br>
            • Genetic code is different. When you’re born you get either a short or a long gene from each parent. These
            are called alleles. It turns out having one or more short ones is linked to having more of a proclivity
            towards being depressed when something bad happens. <br>
            • History of other disorders or concurrent mental health conditions. Post-traumatic stress, substance use
            disorders, and learning disabilities are commonly associated with or can perpetuate depression. Anxiety is a
            big one: Up to 50% of people who have depression also have an anxiety disorder. <br>
            • Stressful or major life events. Abuse, financial issues, the death of a loved one, the loss of a job—these
            situations can all trigger depression. But even positive events like a big move, getting married,
            graduating, or retiring can make you feel depressed, too. For one these events alter your routine, but they
            can also trigger feelings that whatever the success or happy occasion is, isn’t deserved. <br>
            • Hormone changes. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and giving birth can cause bouts of depression. <br>
            • Certain physical conditions, like chronic pain or headaches, show a correlation with—or may spur
            on—depression. <br>
            • Certain medications, like sleeping aids and blood pressure medication, may also cause symptoms of
            depression.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cont4">
        <h2>What Are the Different Types of Depression?</h2>
        <p>
            Major depression is the classic type of depression and what’s diagnosed, or labeled, as MDD (it’s also known
            as unipolar depression). People with major depression have symptoms of depression most of the day, nearly
            every day, for episodes of at least two weeks and can experience recurrent episodes throughout their lives.
            Under MDD, you can further break down depression into several specific subtypes:
        </p><br>
        <p>
            • Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) emerges during particular seasons of the year—commonly winter—brought on
            from diminished natural sunlight. <br>
            • Atypical Depression’s biggest differentiator is mood reactivity. People with this kind of depression see
            their mood improve when something positive happens. <br>
            • Bipolar Disorder used to be called manic depression and involves alternating between episodes of
            depression and extremely elevated energy. <br>
            • Psychotic Depression occurs when a person experiences depressive episodes so severe they start having
            false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing things that others can’t hear or see (hallucinations).
            <br>
            • Postpartum Depression occurs after giving birth. Mothers may feel disconnected from their new baby or fear
            that they could hurt their child. <br>
            • Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is a severe type of depression that shows up during the second half of the
            menstrual cycle. <br>
            • Situational Depression, or adjustment disorder, refers to depression that is triggered by a significant
            life-changing event. <br>
            • Persistent Depressive Disorder used to be called dysthymia. It’s a chronic form of depression—usually with
            milder symptoms—in which an episode lingers for a long period of time, sometimes two years or more. It could
            be described as feeling like you’re living on autopilot.

    <div class="cont5">
        <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Depression</h2>
        <p>
            Experiencing a combination of these symptoms—along with at least a low mood or loss of pleasure—for a period
            of at least two weeks could signify a depressive episode <br>
            • Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or emptiness. You generally feel down most of
            the time. <br>
            • Loss of interest in activities—even in stuff you used to love. It’s like you just lose motivation and feel
            disinterested. <br>
            • Trouble sleeping or oversleeping. You have a hard time falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting out of
            bed. We’re not talking the occasional snooze-hitting; this is like your body is covered in a 50-pound
            weighted blanket and you can’t get out of bed. <br>
            • Appetite or weight changes. You’re overeating, lose your appetite, or experience significant weight gain
            or loss without dieting (about 20 percent of your weight). Sometimes people get a little rush from eating
            and so they seek that lift and it leads to over-eating; other times though you may just have no appetite at
            all. <br>
            • Fatigue or decreased energy. You feel exhausted all the time, or you feel like you can spend days on the
            couch or in bed. <br>
            • Difficulty thinking clearly or quickly, remembering details, concentrating, or making decisions. You feel
            distracted and focusing seems impossible. <br>
            • Irritability, frustration, or pessimism. Your mood and headspace feel negative most of the time. <br>
            • Physical aches and pains. You may have headaches, stomachaches, or neck tension. <br>
            • Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, with or without a plan to actually do it. <br>

    <div class="cont6">
        <h2>What Does Depression Look Like?</h2>

        <p>
            We’ll raise your question with a few Q’s of our own: Are you female? Are you a teen? Depression can also
            affect different ages and genders in unique ways:
        </p>
        <p>
            Women are more likely to ruminate (worry, dwell on, or rehash negative feelings). This can look like
            negative self-talk, sudden crying spells, feelings of guilt, or blaming oneself. Women are also more likely
            to have depression at the same time as an anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, eating disorder, or
            obsessive-compulsive behavior.
            Men with depression are more likely to show signs of irritability, anger, apathy, escapist behavior (like
            spending more time at work), or reckless behavior (like misusing alcohol or other substances).

        </p>
        <p>
            Younger people can struggle with depression and MDD (even though the average age of onset is 32). Children
            and teens may sometimes exhibit oversensitivity, social withdrawal, poor school performance, frequent
            physical complaints (like headaches and stomachaches), or feelings of incompetence and despair (like they
            can’t do anything right or that everything is their fault).
        </p>
        <p>
            Older adults and the elderly are often misdiagnosed or undertreated for depression because their symptoms
            can be mistaken for other disorders (for example, confusion or memory problems caused by depression can look
            like Alzheimer’s disease), or they may assume their feelings are just an inevitable part of aging. For many,
            sadness isn’t the biggest indicator of depression; instead, physical complaints (aches and pains, worsening
            headaches) are often the predominant symptom. Sleep trouble, low motivation, neglect of personal care or
            hygiene, and fixation on death are other signs of depression in older adults.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont7">

        <h2>How Is Depression Diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>
            These days, a routine doctor’s visit with your general health practitioner may be all it takes to receive a
            diagnosis. Standard screening tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)—a survey of yes, nine
            items, that physicians use to assess the severity of depression—are becoming widely used in primary care
            settings to screen for the condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, “most patients with depression are going to be diagnosed and treated by primary care doctors, not
            specialists or psychiatrists,” says James Murrough, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Depression and Anxiety
            Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depression is mainly diagnosed by history and clinical presentations, or a specific pattern of symptoms,
            says Dr. Murrough, which is to say there’s no blood test for MDD. But if you have symptoms like changes in
            sleep or appetite, your doctor may look into other conditions unrelated to mental health (a thyroid issue is
            the classic example).
        </p>
        <p>
            “The first thing your doctor might do is order blood tests—not to make the diagnosis of depression, but to
            rule out things that could be masquerading as depression,” explains Dr. Murrough. “For example, an
            underactive thyroid can present as low mood and feeling sluggish, and iron deficiency anemia is another
            reason why some people might have low energy.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, doctors are looking for a consistent pattern of symptoms that represent a “clear change from the
            way someone was before, as well as objective signs of functional impairment,” says Dr. Murrough. They’ll ask
            when your symptoms started and how you felt before, look at your family history, and use your score from the
            PHQ-9 to aid in the diagnosis. It’s also important to note that when a patient mentions thoughts of suicide,
            that’s a major red flag.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont8">
        <h2>Depression and Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Between hormonal changes, stress, and other environmental changes, getting pregnant can supercharge the
            D-word.</p>
        <h3 class="cnt8h3">Perinatal Depression</h3>
        <p>
            What to expect when you’re expecting? For as many as 23% of people who conceive, this period can come with
            the unwelcome arrival of depressive symptoms. Perinatal depression includes major and minor depressive
            episodes that occur during pregnancy or in the first 12 months after delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            During pregnancy, hormone changes can affect the chemicals in your brain, and it can sometimes result in
            exacerbated anxiety or depression. But possible triggers can also include infertility treatments, previous
            pregnancy loss, and having complications during pregnancy. The signs and symptoms for depression during
            pregnancy, also known as antepartum depression, are similar to MDD and can be effectively treated with the
            right help (even with drug-free approaches like talk therapy).
        </p>
        <h3 class="cnt8h3">The Post-Baby Blues</h3>
        <p>
            If you experience a bit of emotional “baby blues” after childbirth—mood swings, crying spells, and anxiety
            that keeps you up at night—go easy on yourself because most new mothers go through this (hello, major life
            change!). If after two weeks, these symptoms have persisted, it could be postpartum depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Studies have shown that one in seven mothers experience postpartum depression in the year after they give
            birth. People with a previous history of depression may have a higher chance of developing postpartum
            depression. Talk with your doctor about a game plan for treatment and make it a point to ask for help from
            friends and family whenever you need it (parenthood is stressful enough!). And as always, remember that
            perinatal depression is neither shameful, nor a character flaw or sign of weakness.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont9">
        <h2>What Are the Treatments for Depression?</h2>
        <p>There are ever-evolving ways to treat depression, and the mix will depend on everything from how long you’ve
            had it and the severity of your symptoms.</p>
        <h3 class="cnt8h3">Medications</h3>

        <p>
            There’s no shame in taking medication to manage your depression. People routinely take medication for
            physical ailments, and having a mental illness isn’t any different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Antidepressants work by affecting neurotransmitters in the brain. Common types of antidepressants include
            selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),
            and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs).Speak with your doctor to determine which drug is
            right for you. If you’re worried about the possible side effects, remember that any medication can be
            tapered down or ceased.
            One major development that’s under psychopharmacological
            research for treatment-resistant depression is ketamine, which is used in medicine as an anesthetic. “It’s
            important to know that ketamine is beneficial for only a very specific subset of the population,” says
            psychologist Jessica Stern, Ph.D., clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU
            Langone Health, “and is only to be used after several other full courses of therapies—both psychotherapy and
            multiple other medications—have been tried extensively.” Meaning, ketamine wouldn’t normally be a first or
            second line of treatment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cnt8h3">Therapy</h3>
        <p>
            Who doesn’t go to therapy these days? It’s as much a part of regular conversation as the weather.
            Psychotherapy (aka talk therapy), sometimes along with medication, can be highly beneficial in treating,
            managing, and reducing the duration of an episode of depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Evidence-based treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,
            and Dialectical Behavior Therapy have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of depression,” says
            Dr. Stern. “These psychotherapies are active skills-based therapies that help individuals develop and
            maintain skills to manage difficult thoughts and feelings.”
            Trained experts like psychiatrists and psychologists can offer many types of these treatments, from light
            therapy for seasonal affective disorder to CBT that works to change your thought processes. One goal of CBT
            includes behavioral activation, an effective treatment and technique in which a therapist can help you
            schedule more enjoyable activities that bring fulfillment, meaning, or pleasure into your life. According to
            Dr. Stern, behavioral activation may even potentially decrease the likelihood of depression for those seeing
            a therapist for reasons other than MDD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therapy may be even more accessible now than ever before. Due to the pandemic, over three-quarters of
            clinicians say they’re now providing their services remotely, primarily via phone or video on a designated
            telehealth platform. So, you have no excuse not to make an appointment. Whether you have MDD or just
            everyday mental health struggles, “research has shown, prior to COVID-19 and now increasingly with COVID-19,
            that telehealth-based psychotherapy is incredibly effective,” Dr. Stern explains. “It allows psychotherapy
            to be conducted very similarly to in-person psychotherapy, while decreasing barriers that may make it
            difficult to attend sessions in person.” In other words, there’s no need to travel or find childcare, and
            your session happens comfortably in your own home.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cnt8h3">Other Treatments</h3>
        <p>
            “Device treatments such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) may
            be beneficial and appropriate for certain individuals,” adds Dr. Stern. TMS, ECT, and vagus nerve
            stimulation (VNS)—a newer treatment that involves surgically implanting a device similar to a pacemaker
            along the peripheral nerve in the neck—are all types of brain-stimulating approaches that may sound very
            sci-fi but can be effective after first trying therapy and medication.

            Any treatment for depression should coincide with maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, a productive
            sleep schedule, and—yes—even mindful self-care practices. These are all helpful in alleviating or reducing
            the severity of symptoms, says Dr. Stern.

            Exercise helps you better cope with stress, and the endorphins released during exercise may give you a
            mental boost. Increased research shows that “exercise and physical activity can have significant effects on
            depression, and particularly in those with mild-to-moderate depression,” she adds. “This may include
            cardiovascular workouts, stretching, or mindfulness-based physical activity like yoga.” The Centers for
            Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that physical activity also helps you sleep better at
            night—setting off a chain reaction for a more supportive routine.

            Meditation is another highly effective way of clearing your head and calming your body. You can also try
            keeping a journal—some people find that it helps to express their thoughts on paper instead of bottling them
            inside. Talk to close friends and family about your struggles, too. Having a social support system plays a
            key part in maintaining your mental health and wellbeing.

            Recovery is a journey, not a destination. Bad days will still come, but with well-targeted treatment, you
            should be able to overcome extreme lows. While science has yet to find a cure for mental disorders such as
            depression, it is entirely possible to live a happy and fulfilling life in spite of it.

            The catch-22 with depression is that your social network is incredibly important for manoeuvring through
            feeling better, but it’s so easy to sabotage your connections to friends and family because you think you
            want to be alone, or you become so withdrawn that people start to leave you alone.

        <h2>Depression and Suicide Risk</h2>
        <p>
            Depression usually does not lead to suicide ideation. But, according to the US Department of Health and
            Human Services, studies have shown that about two percent of people who have been treated for depression in
            an outpatient setting will die by suicide. If the treatment is inpatient, the number doubles to four
            percent. Men are more likely to die by suicide after depression than women.
