            <h2>What Is PTSD?</h2>
            <p>
                If you live through a terrifying event or experience, such as a horrific car crash, a killer tornado
                that cripples your hometown, or domestic violence, you are likely to feel shattered and experience
                difficulty coping and adjusting. However, as time goes on, and with good individual care, you are likely
                to get better and move on with your life. On the other hand, if you can’t stop reliving the experiences
                and it affects your everyday functioning, you might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
                (PTSD). If you are suffering from this debilitating condition, you are not alone, but great treatment
                options are available.

            <h2>PTSD Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                There is no way of knowing who will develop post-traumatic stress disorder after a traumatizing event.
                As evidenced by past research, the majority of people who witness or live through a traumatic event will
                not suffer from PTSD. Most will likely have memories of the events, but their lives will not become
                negatively impacted by it in their daily interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Symptoms of PTSD include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoidance</li>
                    <li>Intrusive memories</li>
                    <li>Changes in emotional reactions</li>
                    <li>Negative changes in thinking and mood</li>
                    <li>Flashbacks</li>
                    <li>Jumpiness (literally “jumping out of one's skin”)</li>
                    <li>Emotional detachment</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>These symptoms can come and go and vary in intensity.</h3>

            <h2>PTSD Causes, Risk Factors, and Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                You are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder if the traumatic event you endure is
                life-threatening or severely traumatic to your personal safety. Additionally, the more exposure to the
                event or prolonged exposure to a traumatic event is also more likely to increase your chances of
                developing PTSD. Other risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Family history of PTSD and depression</li>
                    <li>History of physical or sexual abuse</li>
                    <li>High level of stress in your daily life</li>
                    <li>Lack of coping skills</li>
                    <li>Not getting help or support after the traumatic event</li>
                    <li>History of depression, anxiety, or other mental illness</li>
                    <li>History of substance abuse</li>
                    <li>Careers that exposure you to traumatic experiences (e.g., military, police, first responders)
                    </li>
                    <li>Experiencing previous traumatic events, especially early in one’s life</li>
                    <li>The extent that the traumatic event was uncontrollable, inescapable, or unexpected</li>
                    <li>Type of traumatic event – intentional, human-afflicted harm (e.g., rape, sexual abuse) is more
                        likely to result in PTSD than any natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, earthquake)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can increase your chances for other mental illnesses, such
                as depression and anxiety, suicide, eating disorders, and issues with drugs and alcohol. Therefore, it
                is especially important to seek treatment if you are suffering from PTSD for your own well-being. You
                should seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder if you are experiencing any of these symptoms
                and are not able to function or cannot function effectively in your day-to-day life. Individuals may be
                affected differently by the symptoms of PTSD. PTSD symptoms in women, men, and children may present
                themselves in a variety of situations depending upon the trauma they have experienced.
                Diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is completed by medical professionals. Your diagnosis will
                be based on psychological evaluations of your signs and symptoms. To be diagnosed with post-traumatic
                stress disorder, you must meet the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                Disorders published by the American Psychological Association. In addition to experiencing or witnessing
                a traumatic event, you must experience one or more of the following after exposure to the traumatic
                event:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reliving the traumatic event</li>
                <li>Upsetting dreams/nightmares about the traumatic event</li>
                <li>Experience of flashbacks</li>
                <li>Experience of emotional distress related to the traumatic event</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                In combination with these symptoms, you may also experience debilitating behaviors and emotions one
                month or more post-traumatic event to include things such as avoidance behaviors, memory loss, emotional
                numbness, self-destructive behavior, and difficulty sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>Your doctor or mental health professional will then make a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder
                and refer to you a number of treatment options.</p>

            <h2>PTSD Treatment</h2>

            <p>
                Several types of treatment options are available if you are suffering from post-traumatic stress
                disorder. The most often prescribed method of treatment is psychotherapy. Medications and other types of
                physical treatment options are also prescribed. Your doctor will formulate the best treatment course of
                action for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Psychotherapy</strong>, often referred to as “talk therapy” has been shown to elicit great
                responses from sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cognitive therapy is focused on recognizing
                patterns of thinking that get you “stuck” in your emotional state. For example, this type of therapy
                might help you in recognizing cognitive patterns associated with negative perceptions of normal
                situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Exposure therapy</strong> is often coupled with cognitive therapy if you have been diagnosed
                with PTSD. It focuses on safe exposure to what is causing you intense fear. This exposure enables you to
                cope with the stimulus effectively and rationally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)</strong> is a form of therapy that combines
                exposure therapy with guided eye movements. The combination of guided eye movements and exposure therapy
                helps you in your cognitive processing of traumatic events and allows you to effectively change your
                reactions to these types of events.
