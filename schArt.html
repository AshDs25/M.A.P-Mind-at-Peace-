        <h2>What Exactly Is Schizophrenia?</h2>
        <p>
            If schizophrenia had a nickname, it would be: Misunderstood. That's because it's every shade of complicated.
            And, to confuse matters more, each of its symptoms appear in at least one other psychiatric disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The easiest way to make sense of it is to say what it's not. Schizophrenia is not characterized by split or
            multiple personalities (aka dissociative identity disorder), or the extreme shifts in mood that come with
            bipolar disorder. And people with schizophrenia aren't prone to violence—or genius, for that matter, in
            spite of what you might have seen in the film “A Beautiful Mind.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The disorder affects more men than women—the ratio is 1.4 to 1—and it strikes men earlier, too. Age of onset
            for men tends to be in the late teens to early 20s; for women, onset typically occurs in the early 20s to
            early 30s. Experts believe this has something to do with the pruning of neurons, a process that takes place
            after birth in babies, which happens later for women than for men.

        <h2>How Schizophrenia Manifests?</h2>
        <p>
            People with schizophrenia experience what's called a psychotic break, which is the onset of psychosis: It's
            when their mind is overtaken by hallucinations and/or delusions that make it hard to know what's real and
            what's not. But while the word “break” sounds sudden, symptoms of schizophrenia don't happen in a single
            traumatic moment. Instead, they are usually gradual and can progress for years, and they can be easy to
            miss—until they're impossible to ignore. Here's how the disorder can manifest
        </p>



        <h3 class="cnt8h3">The Symptoms of Schizophrenia</h2>
            <p>
                Symptoms of schizophrenia are generally put into two categories: positive or negative. But don't be
                fooled by the term “positive”; these symptoms aren't positive in the good sense. “Positive symptoms are
                experiences which are not generally part of everyday experience,” says Dr. Russell Margolis, M.D.,
                Clinical Director at the Johns Hopkins
                Schizophrenia Center in Baltimore and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, positive symptoms are created or added to a person's life by the disease. The experience
                of positive symptoms in schizophrenia designates that break with reality that comes with psychosis.
                Patients can experience either hallucinations or delusions, or both simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like positive schizophrenia symptoms are added to someone's life, negative symptoms are what the
                disease takes away. “They are the absence of something that's normally present in life, such as goals,
                interests, and initiative,” says Dr. Margolis. “The person just doesn't want to do things anymore. They
                may just want to sit around all day; they may not speak very much or have spontaneous ideas. It's like
                everything is turned down.

                    <p>
                        Hallucinations: These are sensory experiences that are not comprehensible to others but feel
                        perfectly real and vivid to the person experiencing them. Roughly 70% of people with
                        schizophrenia will have hallucinations. Auditory hallucinations—hearing voices or sounds that
                        aren't there—are the most common, affecting more than 83% of patients

                        Delusions: Defined as false beliefs or beliefs that conflict with reality, people with
                        schizophrenia hold strong to these notions despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. Delusions
                        come in many forms

                        Thought insertion: The belief that your thoughts are not your own, rather they were placed there
                        by an outside source.

                    can observe or collect them (say, aliens or the government), or that people around you can read your
                    mind.

        <h2>How Common is Childhood Schizophrenia?</h2>
        <p>
            Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) is a rare and poorly understood illness, affecting only about 1 in
            40,000 children. It's considered COS when diagnosed in kids under 13 years old. Though the symptoms are very
            similar on paper to those of adult schizophrenia, they can be even more difficult to diagnose in children
            than adults, because symptoms can be easily mistaken for normal kid-like behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, early warning signs of COS include shyness, introversion, loneliness, depression, and
            manic-like behavior, all of which could be chalked up to “kids being kids.” And children have wild
            imaginations (Think: monsters in the closet), which can be used to explain away the possibility of
            hallucinations or delusions. What's more, symptoms overlap with those found in other more common childhood
            disorders such as autism and ADHD, adding to the challenge of accurate diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treatment for COS looks very similar to that for adults—antipsychotic medication combined with
            psychotherapy, with the addition of academic and social support. Unfortunately, the condition is not likely
            to go away even with treatment, and instead continues into adulthood. Early diagnosis is key to helping
            children and their families better prepare to cope with the chronic illness.
