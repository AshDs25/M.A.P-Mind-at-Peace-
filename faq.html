                <p>There is no single cause of depression, but there are factors that might increase the chance of it.

                    include encouraging treatment, listening with compassion, helping the person suffering with daily
                    tasks, be vigilant for signs of suicidal behaviour, and to make sure you are caring for yourself,

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Surprisingly, some experts say that it can. “For some people, depression is cyclical or seasonal, and
                    they can eventually recover and remit without any specific intervention,” says James Murrough, M.D.,
                    Ph.D., Director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai.
                    "But we also know that treatments like psychotherapy and medications can severely reduce the
                    symptoms and duration of an episode of depression. Many individuals who suffer from depression never
                    seek treatment, and that’s why from a public health perspective we want to keep reducing the stigma
                    around it.”</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>When you experience a loss of someone close to you, it’s normal to grieve and feel down and empty
                        for a period of several weeks or more, “but it should get better,” says Dr. Murrough. “If you’re
                        starting to feel worse instead of better as time goes on, that’s a red flag.” Perhaps, more
                        critically, a typical grief reaction isn’t: “My life is not worth living anymore.” Consider
                        seeking treatment if you or someone experiences this.</p>

                    <p>While no specific diet has been proven to relieve depression, a healthy diet can help you feel
                        your best physically and mentally. Certain foods may be linked to brain health and support for
                        memory, alertness, and mood. Examples include foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids (found in
                        nuts and fatty fish like salmon), antioxidants (blueberries, broccoli), and nutrients like
                        choline (found in egg yolk). Always talk with your doctor before making any major diet changes.

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Addiction is a chronic brain disease that compels you to repetitively use a substance or engage in a
                    behavior despite detrimental consequences to mind, body, and general well-being. The reward or high
                    that addictive substances or behaviors trigger acts as an incentive. Over time, people with
                    addiction become reliant on addictive substances or behaviours, causing long-lasting brain changes.

            <!-- faq answer -->

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Addiction is caused by a combination of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors,
                    including stress. Certain genetic traits or a family history of addiction can make you more
                    vulnerable. A wide range of life experiences and exposures, such as trauma, neglect, weak social
                    ties, and other mental health conditions, can make someone more likely to try addictive substances
                    in the first place or increase the likelihood that they become addicted.</p>

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>To break an addiction, the brain and body need to relearn how to exist and cope without the presence
                    of an addictive substance or behavior the victim must learn to manage cravings and triggers to
                    addiction, especially stress, pain, and social influences. This usually requires support, treatment,
                    and lifelong follow-up to avoid relapsing. The type of treatment will depend on the individual and

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Like other chronic diseases, addiction damages the normal and healthy functioning of a critical
                        organ in the body, in this case, the brain. The brains of people with addiction become dependent
                        on the presence of an addictive substance or behaviour and the reward or high that it triggers.

                <p>The causes of anxiety are individual. While some anxiety disorders are hereditary–meaning they run in

                <p>When someone is managing their bipolar disorder well, they likely won’t appear any different from
                    anyone else. If they’re in a manic episode you might notice they talk fast, switch topics
                    continually, have grandiose plans or ideas, or take risks. When in a depressed episode they may have
                    trouble getting out of bed, show a lack of interest in activities they used to love, not engage in
                    conversation, have difficulty socializing or interacting with others, or have suicidal thoughts.</p>

            <!-- faq answer -->

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>There are times when you feel terrific and productive when you are manic, like you can do anything.
                    But you can also feel out of control with racing thoughts and unable to concentrate long enough to
                    accomplish something. When in a depressed episode, you can feel sad, uninterested in anything, and
                    really low like something terrible must have happened but nothing did.</p>

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Both men and women are affected equally and have similar symptoms. However, men usually experience
                    mania first while women typically start with depressive episodes. Women and people with bipolar II
                    disorder are significantly more likely to experience periods of rapid cycling than men with the same
                    condition. Other research findings indicate that women with bipolar disorder may have more
                    depressive episodes and more mixed episodes than do men with the illness.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Absolutely! People with well-managed bipolar disorders have jobs, families, and are productive
                        members of our society. Bipolar disorder, while a chronic condition, doesn’t define you. Just
                        like people who manage their diabetes or heart condition, you can learn to manage and control
                        bipolar disorders with medications, therapies, and good lifestyle habits that sets you up for a
                        successful life.</p>

                    (hallucinations, delusions). But in individuals with schizoaffective disorder, they will invariably
                    have a mood state on top of their core psychotic symptoms, and so they sometimes flip into a state
                    of mania or depression.</p>

                <p>Triggers are very individual, and they can either set off the process of schizophrenia in someone
                    who’s already vulnerable or lead to a relapse. Some common triggers include stress, substance abuse
                    (especially marijuana abuse), a disrupted sleep/wake cycle, or discontinuing the use of
                    antipsychotic medications.</p>
